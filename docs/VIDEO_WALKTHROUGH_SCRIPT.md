## Shot-by-Shot Storyboard

### SCENE 1: Introduction & Hook [0:00-0:30]

**Visual:**
- Open on Title screen of Truth Hunters
- Logo animation (🔍 magnifying glass icon + "TRUTH HUNTERS" text)
- Quick montage (3-4 seconds each):
  - Students collaborating around a Chromebook
  - Claim card showing an interesting scientific fact
  - Leaderboard with team names
  - Achievement badge popping up

**Voiceover Script:**
> "In a world where AI-generated misinformation is everywhere, how do we teach students to think critically? Meet Truth Hunters: a research-backed game that trains middle schoolers to detect AI errors, calibrate their confidence, and work together as epistemic detectives."

**On-screen Text:**
- "Truth Hunters"
- "Teach Critical Thinking Through Play"

---

### SCENE 2: What is Truth Hunters? [0:30-1:30]

**Visual:**
- Transition to talking head (teacher or developer)
- OR continue screen recording with animated callouts

**Voiceover Script:**
> "Truth Hunters is a cooperative learning game for students in grades 6-8. Teams of 2-4 students evaluate claims—some from expert sources, some generated by AI with deliberate errors.
>
> Students vote whether each claim is TRUE, FALSE, or MIXED, then set their confidence level: low, medium, or high. Here's the twist: higher confidence means higher stakes. If you're very confident and CORRECT, you earn 5 points. But if you're very confident and WRONG? You lose 6 points. This teaches calibration—knowing when you really know something versus when you're guessing.
>
> The game is built on peer-reviewed research in epistemic education: Johnson and Johnson's cooperative learning, Wineburg's lateral reading strategies, and Lichtenstein's calibration training methods. It's not just a game—it's a pedagogical tool."

**On-screen Text (animated):**
- "✓ 94 Curated Claims"
- "✓ Research-Backed Design"
- "✓ Cooperative Learning (2-4 Players)"
- "✓ Confidence Calibration Training"
- "✓ AI Error Pattern Recognition"

**Visual Aids:**
- Example claim card
- Scoring table showing risk/reward
- Citations appearing in corner (Johnson & Johnson 2009, Wineburg et al. 2022)

### SCENE 3: Guided Gameplay Demo [1:30-3:00]

#### **Part A: Game Setup** [1:30-2:00]

**Visual:** Screen recording - Setup Screen

**Voiceover Script:**
> "Let's walk through setting up a game. Students start by naming their team—the game has built-in moderation to ensure appropriate names. Then they add 2-4 players with first names and avatars. Fun fact: this student identity feature helps with cooperative accountability.
>
> Next, choose your difficulty: easy, medium, hard, or mixed for variety. Select subjects—we have claims in Biology, Physics, History, Geography, and more. Finally, set the number of rounds. For a 30-minute class period, we recommend 8-10 rounds."

**Screen Recording Actions:**
1. Type team name: "The Truth Seekers"
2. Add 4 players: "Maya", "Jordan", "Alex", "Sam" with different avatars
3. Select "Mixed Difficulty"
4. Check several subject boxes (Biology, History, Physics)
5. Set rounds to 10
6. Click "Start Game"

**On-screen Callouts:**
- Arrow pointing to moderation notice: "Content filtered for middle school"
- Circle around difficulty selector: "Adaptive learning"
- Highlight round counter: "~3 minutes per round"

#### **Part B: Active Gameplay** [2:00-2:45]

**Visual:** Screen recording - Playing Screen

**Voiceover Script:**
> "Now we're in the game. Here's a claim: 'The human brain uses exactly 10% of its capacity at any given time.' The team discusses—is this TRUE, FALSE, or MIXED?
>
> Let's say they decide it's FALSE because they remember it's a common myth. They vote FALSE, then set confidence to HIGH because they're certain. They submit, and... CORRECT! They earn 5 points and see the explanation: this is an AI-generated myth perpetuation error. The brain actually uses much more than 10% of its capacity.
>
> Notice the calibration tip that pops up: 'Great calibration! Your confidence matched reality.' These real-time feedback messages help students metacognitively reflect on their thinking process."

**Screen Recording Actions:**
1. Show claim card appearing
2. Mouse hovers over verdict options (TRUE/FALSE/MIXED)
3. Select FALSE
4. Set confidence to High (●●●)
5. Click Submit
6. Reveal result: ✓ CORRECT +5 PTS
7. Explanation appears with AI error pattern highlighted
8. Calibration tip displays
9. Click "Next Round" to show transition

**On-screen Callouts:**
- "Discuss before voting" (speech bubbles icon)
- "Higher risk = higher reward"
- "Learning feedback, not just scoring"

#### **Part C: Keyboard Shortcuts** [2:45-3:00]

**Visual:** Quick demonstration of keyboard navigation

**Voiceover Script:**
> "Pro tip: Students can use keyboard shortcuts for faster play. T for TRUE, F for FALSE, M for MIXED. Numbers 1, 2, 3 for confidence. And Enter to submit. This keeps the game moving and accessible."

**Screen Recording:**
- Hands-free demonstration using only keyboard
- Keys light up on screen as pressed

### SCENE 4: Teacher Dashboard [3:00-4:00]

**Visual:** Screen recording - Teacher Dashboard

**Voiceover Script:**
> "Now, let's look at the teacher view. Click 'Teacher Dashboard' at the bottom of the home screen, or add '?teacher=true' to your URL.
>
> Here, you can see class-wide leaderboards—if you've set up Firebase, which is optional. You can filter by class period using class codes, export to CSV for gradebook integration, and track which teams are excelling.
>
> The analytics tab shows you subject performance: which topics students struggle with, accuracy trends, and even which AI error patterns they're detecting most successfully. This is formative assessment data you can use to guide instruction.
>
> If students submit custom claims, they appear in the Moderation Queue. You can approve, reject, or edit submissions before they enter the game pool. This transforms students from consumers to creators of epistemic content."

**Screen Recording Actions:**
1. Click "Teacher Dashboard" link
2. Show leaderboard with multiple teams
3. Filter by class code dropdown
4. Click "Export CSV" button
5. Switch to Analytics tab
6. Point out subject performance chart
7. Navigate to Claim Moderation (even if empty)
8. Show Firebase configuration panel

**On-screen Callouts:**
- "Optional: Firebase for cross-device leaderboards"
- "FERPA-compliant: no PII collected"
- "Use class codes to separate periods"

### SCENE 5: Tips for Classroom Use [4:00-4:45]

**Visual:** Split-screen or B-roll of classroom (if available), otherwise continue dashboard

**Voiceover Script:**
> "Here are my top tips for using Truth Hunters effectively:
>
> **One**: Use it for cooperative learning, not individual assessment. Assign mixed-ability groups of 3-4 students per device. The collaboration is where the real learning happens.
>
> **Two**: Debrief after games. The post-game screen shows all claims and explanations. Use this as a springboard for discussion: 'Why did we fall for that plausible adjacency error? What clues should we have noticed?'
>
> **Three**: Connect to your curriculum. Before a unit on ecosystems, filter to Biology claims. Studying World War II? Select History claims. The game reinforces content while teaching metacognitive skills.
>
> **Four**: Enable Presentation Mode for whole-class play. Click the glasses icon in the header to enlarge text. One team plays while the class watches and discusses on a projector.
>
> **Five**: Use it offline. The game works completely offline with local leaderboards. Perfect for schools with spotty Wi-Fi or Chromebooks that don't always connect."

**On-screen Text (bullet points):**
- "✓ Groups of 3-4 students"
- "✓ Debrief with explanations"
- "✓ Align to curriculum units"
- "✓ Presentation Mode for projectors"
- "✓ Works offline"
