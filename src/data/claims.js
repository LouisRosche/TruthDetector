 * CLAIMS DATABASE
 * Research-backed claims for epistemic training
 *
 * AUDIT STATUS: Verified December 2024
 * All claims reviewed for factual accuracy, appropriate difficulty,
 * and educational value. TRUE claims verified against peer-reviewed
 * sources. FALSE/MIXED claims designed to teach specific error patterns.
 *
 * Each claim has:
 * - id: Unique identifier (format: subject-difficulty-number)
 * - text: The claim to evaluate
 * - answer: 'TRUE' | 'FALSE' | 'MIXED'
 * - source: 'ai-generated' | 'expert-sourced'
 * - explanation: Why the answer is what it is
 * - errorPattern: Type of error (see AI_ERROR_PATTERNS)
 * - subject: Academic subject area
 * - difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard'
 * - gradeLevel: 'elementary' | 'middle' | 'high' | 'college' (default: 'middle')
 * - citation: Source URL or DOI (for TRUE claims)
 * - lastVerified: Date of last fact-check
 * - reviewedBy: Array of reviewer identifiers
 *
 * GRADE LEVEL GUIDE:
 * - elementary (K-5): Simple, concrete facts. Age 5-11. Fun, memorable, shareable.
 * - middle (6-8): Standard complexity. Age 11-14. Current default level.
 * - high (9-12): Nuanced analysis required. Age 14-18. More context needed.
 * - college: Sophisticated, specialized. Age 18+. Expert-level critical thinking.
